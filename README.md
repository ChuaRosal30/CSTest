# Phase 1: Problem statement: 

# The recent rise of intense floods has currently resurfaced. Now that it has returned, it is a world-wide issue that has affected millions of people and the lives that they are going through. Intense flooding has caused exposure to intense injuries/deaths and illnesses, destruction of both personal and public properties worth millions, and significant economic losses because of the crop destruction and disruption of commerce. In recent statistics posted by the Philippine Natural Disaster Health Risk Reduction and Management Operations Center, a total of 225 occurrences of small-scale natural hazard incidents were recorded in 2024. The most frequently reported incidents were flash floods or flooding, accounting for 53 occurrences or 23.6 percent. This shows that our country has yet to act upon this dire issue despite it affecting thousands of lives every year, and it shows how we urgently need to fix this issue before it continues hurting us as a country.

# Phase 2: Creation of Objectives: 
# To create an application thatâ€¦

# a. Calculates the risk of flood for every province based on a mix of statistical information, history, and environmental conditions like rainfall, river levels, topography, and climatic patterns. The system will also have access to the history of every province's floods, showing records of previous instances of flooding along with supporting information like dates, intensity, and frequency.

# b. Categorizes provinces based on their determined level of flood risk, utilizing a standardized classification level such as low, moderate, high, or critical. The levels of risk will be graphically illustrated through an interactive color map that enables the identification and comparison of areas at risk of flooding nationwide.

# c. Creates corresponding evacuation plans, reduction strategies for risk, and emergency response procedures depending on the risk classification of each province. This will incorporate pre-designed plans specific to various risk categories. The system will also give an emergency contact numbers directory and evacuation center locations applicable per area.

# d. Incorporates real-time monitoring capabilities that give constant reports on rain intensity, river conditions, and weather-related warnings. The system will send warnings to alert users about shifting conditions and possible flooding depending on the location.

# e. Provides an implementation of a community reporting capability that enables users to report on active flood events. These reports will be accessible in the application and archived in a database to feed into subsequent updates in affected provinces' flood histories and risk factors.

# Phase 3: Creation of Features:

# Calculates the risk of flooding in each province (using statistics, environmental factors, and flooding history) to identify the most prone provinces.

# Categorizes each province according to their estimated risk through a color-coded system. 

# Recommends an evacuation plan, risk reduction plan, and/or emergency response plan according to the risk category of each province. Additionally contains the phone numbers of local emergency response teams.

# Phase 4: Psuedocode Writing
# Step 1: Gather the statistics, environmental conditions, and the past flood history data of each province.

# Step 2: Analyze the data and identify the risk provided by the statistics provide.

# Step 3: With the analyzed data, color code the province based on how likely the place is to be flooded by low ( green - not serious), intermediate (not very serious), and critical (very serious).

# Step 4: Using the color coding, make designed evacuation and safety plans that fit the flooding situation of each area. 

# Step 5: Apply the system into each province. 

# Phase 5: Coding with Visual Support:

# Step 1: Gathering data (statistics, environmental conditions, flood history)
